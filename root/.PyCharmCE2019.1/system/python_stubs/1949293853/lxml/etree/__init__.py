        Defaults to ASCII encoding without XML declaration.  This

        (string) and 'xml_declaration' (bool).  Note that changing the
        encoding to a non UTF-8 compatible encoding will enable a
        declaration by default.
    
        You can also serialise to a Unicode string without declaration by
        passing the ``unicode`` function as encoding (or ``str`` in Py3),
        or the name 'unicode'.  This changes the return value from a byte
        string to an unencoded unicode string.

        Default is 'xml'.
    
        The ``exclusive`` and ``with_comments`` arguments are only used
        with C14N output, where they request exclusive and uncommented
        C14N serialisation respectively.
    
        Passing a boolean value to the ``standalone`` option will output
        an XML declaration with the corresponding ``standalone`` flag.
    
        The ``doctype`` option allows passing in a plain string that will
        be serialised before the XML tree.  Note that passing in non
        well-formed content here will make the XML output non well-formed.
        Also, an existing doctype in the document tree will not be removed
        when serialising an ElementTree instance.
    
        You can prevent the tail text of the element from being serialised
