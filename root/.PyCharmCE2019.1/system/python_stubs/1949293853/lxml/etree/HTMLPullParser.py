    HTMLPullParser(self, events=None, *, tag=None, base_url=None, **kwargs)
    
        HTML parser that collects parse events in an iterator.
    
        The collected events are the same as for iterparse(), but the
        parser itself is non-blocking in the sense that it receives
        data chunks incrementally through its .feed() method, instead
        of reading them directly from a file(-like) object all by itself.
    
        By default, it collects Element end events.  To change that,
        pass any subset of the available events into the ``events``
        argument: ``'start'``, ``'end'``, ``'start-ns'``,
        ``'end-ns'``, ``'comment'``, ``'pi'``.
    
        To support loading external dependencies relative to the input
        source, you can pass the ``base_url``.
